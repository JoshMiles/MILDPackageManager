=== Pushing Packages === 

Here is a tutorial on how to push a package to the FilesDB.

You will need;

- A developer key

- A name for the package

- A link to it's source code's archive available for download via HTTP

- Your own name

- A website (can just be a issues page on github or a wiki)

- A dependancies list

To begin with, you first need to change directory into the dir named
"PackageManagement". Once you are in there; you need to run the script entitled
"push" by using the command "./push" (assuming it is executable).

The push script will launch a C# program (is uses mono).
It will provide a step by step wizard on submitting a package.

=== The Developers Key ===
The developers key is actually two unique strings with 16 characters in each.
It is used to push packages to the FilesDB. When it is used to push
a package, the developers key is assigned to the package and therefore
you can only use the DK (developers key) to delete the package from the
server or to edit a package's details (the Developers Key has to be
used in conjunction with the package's key in order to make changes).
 
=== How to get a developers key ===

Unfortunately, we are unable to open the FilesDB server to everyone as
that would have severe security risks. 
Application for a developers key is currently not open.
