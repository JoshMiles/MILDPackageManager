=== Pushing Packages === 

Here is a tutorial on how to push a package to the FilesDB.

You will need;

- A developer key

- A name for the package

- A link to it's source code's archive available for download via HTTP

- Your own name

- A website (can just be a issues page on github or a wiki)

- A dependancies list

To begin with, you first need to change directory into the dir named
"PackageManagement". Once you are in there; you need to run the script entitled
"push" by using the command "./push" (assuming it is executable).

The push script will launch a C# program (is uses mono).
It will provide a step by step wizard on submitting a package.

At the end of the process, the wizard will give you a unique package
key which you MUST take note of otherwise you will not be able to
make changes/delete your package from the FilesDB without going through
some hefty authentication process.

=== The Developers Key ===
The developers key is actually two unique strings with 16 characters in each.
It is used to push packages to the FilesDB. When it is used to push
a package, the developers key is assigned to the package and therefore
you can only use the DK (developers key) to delete the package from the
server or to edit a package's details (the Developers Key has to be
used in conjunction with the package's key in order to make changes).
 
=== How to get a developers key ===

Unfortunately, we are unable to open the FilesDB server to everyone as
that would have severe security risks. 
Application for a developers key is currently not open.

=== FilesDB RC ===

Here is how the application pushes packages and make modifications with
the server.
It uses RCs, just as when retrieving package information, to make changes
to the FilesDB.

Here is the RC table.

=Request Code===Request Structure=
= PUSH        = PUSH:[developerkey1]:[developerkey2]:[packagename]:[packageauthor]:[authorwebsite]:[packagedownloadlink]
= PMOD        = PMOD:[developerkey1]:[developerkey2]:[packagekey]:[packagename]:[modifycode]:[modification]
= PDEL        = PDEL:[developerkey1]:[developerkey2]:[packagekey]:[reason]
==================================

The PMOD request code requires you to send a modify code.
Use the table below to find your desired modification code.

=Modify Code===Description=
= 0          = Package download link
= 1          = Package name
= 2          = Package author
= 3          = Package author website
===========================

The RCs are translated in the table below to their binary and hex values.

=Request Code===Binary===Hex=
= PUSH        = 1000   = 8  =
= PMOD        = 1001   = 9  =
= PDEL        = 1010   = A  =
